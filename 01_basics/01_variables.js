//variables in JavaScript

//to print something
console.log("aditya");

//const - we cannot change the value of this
const userId = 123456
// userId = 456789  (not possible)

//let - most popular way to declare a variable
let userName = "aditya"
let userEmail = "adityarastogi620@gmail.com"

//var keyword
var accountPassword = "6969"
/*
perfer not to use var
because of issue in block scope and functional scope
*/

//Javascript also allow to declare variables without writing anything before it
userCity = "Lucknow"
//perfer not to use

//JavaScript say undefined to the variables with no value
let userState


console.log(userId);

//we can print all the variable using table
console.table([userId, userName, userEmail, accountPassword, userCity, userState])

//Note: you can use semicolon(;) to terminate the line, but it is not necessary

//If you like my code do give stars:-)
//Keep coding!!
